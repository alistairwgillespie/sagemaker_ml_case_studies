    "# Time Series Forecasting \n",
    "\n",
    "A time series is data collected periodically, over time. Time series forecasting is the task of predicting future data points, given some historical data. It is commonly used in a variety of tasks from weather forecasting, retail and sales forecasting, stock market prediction, and in behavior prediction (such as predicting the flow of car traffic over a day). There is a lot of time series data out there, and recognizing patterns in that data is an active area of machine learning research!\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='notebook_ims/time_series_examples.png' width=80% />\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll focus on one method for finding time-based patterns: using SageMaker's supervised learning model, [DeepAR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/deepar.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### DeepAR\n",
    "\n",
    "DeepAR utilizes a recurrent neural network (RNN), which is designed to accept some sequence of data points as historical input and produce a predicted sequence of points. So, how does this model learn?\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, you'll provide a training dataset (made of several time series) to a DeepAR estimator. The estimator looks at *all* the training time series and tries to identify similarities across them. It trains by randomly sampling **training examples** from the training time series. \n",
    "* Each training example consists of a pair of adjacent **context** and **prediction** windows of fixed, predefined lengths. \n",
    "    * The `context_length` parameter controls how far in the *past* the model can see.\n",
    "    * The `prediction_length` parameter controls how far in the *future* predictions can be made.\n",
    "    * You can find more details, in [this documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/deepar_how-it-works.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='notebook_ims/context_prediction_windows.png' width=50% />\n",
    "\n",
    "> Since DeepAR trains on several time series, it is well suited for data that exhibit **recurring patterns**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any forecasting task, you should choose the context window to provide enough, **relevant** information to a model so that it can produce accurate predictions. In general, data closest to the prediction time frame will contain the information that is most influential in defining that prediction. In many forecasting applications, like forecasting sales month-to-month, the context and prediction windows will be the same size, but sometimes it will be useful to have a larger context window to notice longer-term patterns in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Energy Consumption Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we'll be working with in this notebook is data about household electric power consumption, over the globe. The dataset is originally taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/electric-power-consumption-data-set), and represents power consumption collected over several years from 2006 to 2010. With such a large dataset, we can aim to predict over long periods of time, over days, weeks or months of time. Predicting energy consumption can be a useful task for a variety of reasons including determining seasonal prices for power consumption and efficiently delivering power to people, according to their predicted usage. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Interesting read**: An inversely-related project, recently done by Google and DeepMind, uses machine learning to predict the *generation* of power by wind turbines and efficiently deliver power to the grid. You can read about that research, [in this post](https://deepmind.com/blog/machine-learning-can-boost-value-wind-energy/).\n",

    "* Loading and exploring the data\n",
    "* Creating training and test sets of time series\n",

    "Next, we need to define some DeepAR hyperparameters that define the model size and training behavior. Values for the epochs, frequency, prediction length, and context length are required.\n",

This is because a DeepAR model also receives \"lagged\" inputs from the target time series, which allow the model to capture long-term dependencies. For example, a daily time series can have yearly seasonality and DeepAR automatically includes a lag of one year. So, the context length can be shorter than a year, and the model will still be able to capture this seasonality. \n",

    "The lag values that the model picks depend on the frequency of the time series. For example, lag values for daily frequency are the previous week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, and year.
